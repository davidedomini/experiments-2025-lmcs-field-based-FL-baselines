# Experiments LMCS Field-based FL Baselines

This repository contains the experiments for a paper on Field-based Federated Learning  submitted in the [LMCS Journal](https://lmcs.episciences.org/).
In particular, here you can find the experiments for the algorithms used as baselines (the experiments on field-based FL are [here](https://github.com/davidedomini/experiments-2025-lmcs-field-based-FL)).
Below you can find a summary of the experiments:
- Algorithms: FedAVG, FedProxy and Scaffold
- Datasets: MNIST, FashionMNIST, Extended MNIST (Handwritten letters) and CIFAR10
- Partitioning methods: iid, hard non-iid, dirichlet distribution
